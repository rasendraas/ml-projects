## ðŸ“‚ Machine Learning & Data Science Projects

Welcome to this repository!
This collection showcases the projects I worked on during Coding Camp 2025 as part of the Machine Learning Engineer path. 
Iâ€™m sharing them here as part of my portfolio and to help fellow learners explore and practice machine learning and data science techniques.

Here youâ€™ll find:

* Data Exploration & Dashboard
* Unsupervised & Supervised Learning
* Sentiment Analysis
* Image Classification
* ETL Pipeline
* Predictive Analysis
* Recommendation System

The main purpose of this repository is to serve as part of my **personal portfolio** and as a **reference for friends and fellow learners** who are interested in exploring machine learning techniques.

> âš  **Note:** Please do not use any of these projects or code in production without careful review, as they were developed solely for learning purposes and to showcase my skills.
